# Financial Trading Bot
This is a simple financial trading bot made with Python, using the OANDA API using a demo account to trade with.

The strategy used here is simple, and only selected for the purposes of completing this project. The bot will observe candle engulfing patterns and if the most recent candle meets the SLTP (StopLossTakeProfit) ratio then it will get a signal to either buy or sell.

If you choose to use this bot with a real account, exercise caution as there are likely more effective strategies available.
